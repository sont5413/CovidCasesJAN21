# I analyzed covid case rates for the month of January 2021 across 5 states that showed the highest increase in covid19 cases
* I analyzed an intercepts and slopes linear mixed effects model with State as the random factor.
* I also analyzed the 95% confidence interval of the fixed effect slope to conclude if rates vary among states. 
* My results showed that the rate of exponential growth did not vary across the states. 
* The slope estimate for all five states (5.02) had a tight 95% confidence interval (4.28 to 5.75) that did not overlap zero (See Table 2, “Fixed Effects”).  
* Trellis plots of the data also show similar rates across all five states.
* I estimated a single model instead of a model for all 5 states in order to decrease the probability of committing a Type I error.
